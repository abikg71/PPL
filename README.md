In repository there are three (3) Programming Assignments named ProgrammingA1, 
ProgrammingA2, and ProgrammingA3. 

ProgrammingA1
This is a first programming assignment of principles of programming language.
Implemented by Python 3.7 or higher in order to learn about how to write a lexical
 and syntax analyzer for a hypothetical programming language (roughly based on Pascal).
 Data types are Integer and Boolean only.

There are to files in this assignment Lexical_Analyzer.py and syntaxA_tree.py
 which are supposted to be one file but I/we did them separate files to save some time.

To run the ProgrammingA1 run the following command in your terminal/command line.  
I am assuming that you have python installed in your machine. Or visit https://www.python.org/downloads/

python3 Lexical_Analyzer.py sources/sourcen.pas
python3 syntaxA_tree.py sources/sourcen.pas
Where n is for source1,2,….. .pas

=>The instruction and detail info about this project can be found on ProgrammingA1.pdf file.
=> The short hand representation formula can be viewed on g_reference.txt file.

ProgrammingA2
This one done by Haskell and we programmed Sudoku game.  You can read more from ProgrammingA2.pdf file 

ProgrammingA3
We did our last assignment in Prolog and the problem we worked on expert system (ES) on diseases. 

To run the source code first of all make sure you have prolog in your computer.
 Or visit the learn prolog now website. 
On your command line or terminal run;
swipl expertsystem.pl and you will get the ff message on your terminal
